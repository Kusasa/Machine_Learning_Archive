1) What may potentially drive why a person chooses one restaurant over the others?
    A) Geo-location:
        - distance from restaurant (the closer the restaurant, the more preferable)
        - area preferences/bias (people in the same area tend to have similar preferences)
        - travel history - i.e. number of order locations (whether a person orders at multiple locations or not tends to affect their order preferences) 
        - location type (the relationship of the person to his/her current location tends to affect their food preferences)
        
    B) Demographics:
        - age
        - sex
        - ethnic group
        - household composition
        - economic class
